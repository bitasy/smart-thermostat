# Smart Thermostat

I created a Smart Thermostat for display in the Duke Internet of Things Showcase, which won the prizes of Most Useful and the Grand Prize. The thermostat was built entirely of parts in the SparkFun Inventor's Kit for Photon, and connects to the dorm room thermostat via a motor for functionality. It can be controlled from my smartphone via the Particle API.
